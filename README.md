# Forza 4 Game

This project is a **Forza 4** game (Connect Four) implemented in Java with a **JavaFX** frontend and backend. The game allows two players to play the classic Connect Four game where the objective is to be the first to form a line of four discs of their color, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
